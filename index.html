            <br>
            in central London. The first God of War game was released in 2005. This eighth instalment in the series, developed by Santa Monica Studio, sees its iconic lead character

            <br>
            He said the win showed that story-led games could be as "relevant" as the presently popular Battle Royale style titles.
            Nintendo's Labo won two awards,
            <br>
            one for best family game and the other for innovation.
